## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to construct a database for the company Pewlett-Hackard to determine what employees are eligible for retirement in all the departments in the company.

## Summary
From this analysis, we can see that Pewlett-Hackard needs to prepare to replace 64% of their workforce with new employees. With the incoming of new employees, a mentorship program needs to be implimented to ensure the new employees take over their new positions without a hitch as the senior employyes pass off their advice and knowledge onto the new generation of employees. Although, the process should be doen slowly due to the fact that over half the company is retiring. The mentor program should eb done in phases, starting with the people who have been employed the longest and then the more recent, slowly phasing in the new employees.
